Program that creates a random numbers table in .pdf to be used in statistics exercises. This project was done with help of ITextSharp and BigInteger libraries.

## 2 - Justification

 hen a estatician have a sample to select, it is important to be imparcial when selecting it. In order to do that, they use a random numbers table to be fully impartial on who or what they are choosing to participate of the research. Due to this, I designed this system to generate these tables.
